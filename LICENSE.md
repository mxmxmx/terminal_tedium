As far as I’m concerned, this pretty much means do with it whatever you want; ideally, have fun using it and share the things that you might come up with. It follows I’m not a huge fan of massive, indiscriminate group buys; it’s not the purpose of open-source to acquire as many things as possible, at the lowest price possible.
